# cleaning-data
Project to clean data in R

There are 4 files in this analysis folder: 

1. The first file is the README, which is the file from which you are reading currently. It contains information about each of the files in the analysis folder. 

2. The script "getandcleandata_project.R" includes the link to the zip file data and the code for creating the new tidy data file. 

To reiterate, the zip file link is: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
The parent site from which the data comes is: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

3. The final product is a dataset called "tidy.txt". The steps that recount it's creation are found in the "getandcleandata_project.R" script.

4.  A code book that (per the guidelines of the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera Course, that set up this project), "modifies and updates the available codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and other relevant information".
